# leaflet-challenge

This project entailed the creation of an earthquake tracing map, with data that can be updated to represent earthquakes occurring in the past 7 days.

Reading the Map:
-Radius and color of the marker represent earthquake magnitude
-There are 3 views that users can select from in the upper right corner (light, street, and satellite views)
-The legend in the bottom right corner represents how the color of the markers change as magnitudes increase
